**GENERAL OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT**

The central purpose of our wine e-commerce platform is to create and maintain a digital space where wine aficionados and enthusiasts can purchase a wide range of products and related items. In addition, we will offer a Membership service that guarantees periodic delivery of premium items and new releases.

Our goal is to provide an enriching experience that promotes connection among wine lovers by offering access to exclusive content, unique events and special discounts.
We aspire to build an active community of experts and aficionados, whose purpose is to enrich each member's wine experience and foster a culture of appreciation and enjoyment of wine.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Given the lack of a centralized and accessible medium in the Americas to meet the needs of wine lovers, we are limited by a number of barriers. These include geography, lack of detailed information, as well as a dearth of exclusive wine references and unique wine experiences.

Without a suitable meeting point, many aficionados are forced to settle for limited options in their local markets or rely on online recommendations.

Now, faced with this situation, the need arises for a specialized wine platform that offers a wide selection of products, quality content, exclusive events, an active community and the delivery of products through a Membership, thus providing a comprehensive solution to the needs of wine lovers around the world.
